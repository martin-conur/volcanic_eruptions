# volcanic_eruptions
### Context

Volcanic eruptions are an exceptional phenomena, one of the few (if not the only one) that's capable to connect the litosphere with the troposphere in very short timescale. Despite the dangers that represents for local inhabitants, volcanic eruption can also affect the whole planet ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer)).

This dataset represent the work of more than 7.000 papers and hundreds of years of research. It summarize the volcanic eruption magnitud (~VEI), date, location and in some cases the volcanic processes related to it.

### Content

**Eruption list contains:**
&gt;Volcano Number = id of the volcano
&gt;Volcano Name 
&gt;Eruption Number = eruption id
&gt;Eruption Category = Confirmed  Eruption or Uncertain Eruption
&gt;Area of Activity = where in the volcano, the eruption occurs (crater,  side walls, a certain area)
&gt;VEI = [volcanic eruption index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_Explosivity_Index), is a logaritmic scale of the eruptions magnitud (from 0 to 8)
&gt;VEI Modifier = I supose it is a post modification to the VEI, but is almost full of nan values
&gt;Start Year Modifier = same that above
&gt;Start Year = Beginning of the eruption
&gt;Start Year Uncertainty = the uncertainty related to the age datation
&gt;Start Month = the month of the eruption
&gt;Start Day Modifier = same as all modifiers
&gt;Start Day = the day of the month were the eruption start
&gt;Start Day Uncertainty = confidence intervals related to the datation method
&gt;Evidence Methon (dating) = The method used to define the date of the eruption
&gt;End Year Modifier = 
&gt;End Year = when the eruption finished
&gt;End Day Modifier = 
&gt;End Day = the day that ends
&gt;End Day Uncertainty = related to the datation method
&gt;Latitude = coordinates y axes
&gt;Longitude = coordinates x axes

### Inspiration

As a geologist and data scientist, volcanoes and data aren't just my field of expertise, they're also my passion. I'm really interested to know what's the future of both interconnected areas.
